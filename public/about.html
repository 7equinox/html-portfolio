<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Julius Evan C. Estonilo, J.E for short. I am currently 20 years old (as of 10th October of 2024). I am an enthusiast fullstack web developer.</p>

<p>I am also passionate in learning software or app development, particularly using Java as one of my favorite programming language that I used. I want to think in a complex way that the future community will be able to use or enhance it that creates huge impact in our society.</p>

<p>I want to learn machine learning in the future. I want to use my previous knowledge in math so that it will not be wasted in my previous times. For now, I want to get a job to be a full stack web developer in the future. I hope that I can contribute to this current IT Industry.</p>
